Stacks data structure
The stack implementation has the following characteristics:
-Only words or doublewords could be saved into the stack, not a byte
-The stack grows in the reverse direction, i.e., toward the lower memory address
-The top of the stack points to the last item inserted in the stack; it points to the lower byte of the last word inserted
